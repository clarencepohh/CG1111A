## Note from the owner of this repository
Hello! It's Clarence, one of the team members who wrote the code for this project repo. 
I'm uploading this code for archival purposes almost 2 years after I took this module, so honestly I don't remember the details of this project as much as I'd like to. 
Do note that the version of code used in our project test run *wasn't the best*, so if you're viewing this for reference, do take note!

## Project details (from what I can remember)
The goal of the project was to create a robot that could traverse a maze, using colored squares as indicators for turns: 
- Red: Turn left
- Green: Turn right
- Blue: Two consecutive right turns
- Purple: Two consecutive left turns
- Orange: U-turn
- White: End of the maze

I believe the run was timed, and you had penalties if your robot was unable to correctly detect a color, or if your robot collided with a wall.
